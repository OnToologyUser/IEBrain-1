From the design viewpoint, the Quality-Region distinction is useful only when individual aspects of an Entity are considered in a domain of discourse. 
For example, in an automotive context, it would be irrelevant to consider the aspects of car windows for a specific car, unless the factory wants to check a specific window against design parameters (anomaly detection).

For example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:

- Beehive means "a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box." (Oxford dictionary)
- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 "beehive|hive" (WordNet)
- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'
- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'
- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'
- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'
- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'
- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'
- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'
- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)

As the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. 
However, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. 
We provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.

In the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). 
Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.
Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. 
A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.
Another approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.
The logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. 
Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.

These different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):

(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)
	- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'
	- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept
	- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description
	- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)
	- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)
	- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)

(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)
	- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl
	- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld

This is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning.

Also, the names of the related properties have been changed in order to make them more intuitive.
Furthermore, a large comment field has been added to the 'expresses' object property, in order to clarify some issues about the many interpretations.
In 3.3, the relation between regions, parameters, and datatypes has been still improved.
In 3.5, the person-related classes have been refactored: Person in 3.4 is now SocialPerson, to avoid confusion with commonsense intuition; Person is now the union of social persons and humans, therefore being a subclass of Agent.
In 3.6, other fixes on universal restriction involving expresses. Also added the property 'isConstraintFor' between parameters and entities. Moved the properties: 'assumes' and 'adopts' to the new module: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/Conceptualization.owl.
In 3.7, some fixes on the names of classes and properties related to FormalEntity; created a new separate module for general universal restrictions (DULGCI.owl).
In 3.8, more fixes on the interface to formal entities and links to IOLite.owl.
In 3.9, some naming and comment fixes.
In 3.10, removed cardinality restriction from hasPart and isPartOf restrictions (changed to hasComponent and isComponentOf), for OWL(DL) compatibility. Also enlarged the range of includesAgent to contain both social and physical agents, and of conceptualizes universal restriction on agents, to include all social objects.
In 3.11, some more subproperty axioms have been introduced, and all elements have got English labels.
In 3.12, added some classes to map some old DolceLitePlus classes that were used to align OntoWordNet.
In 3.13, added the LocalConcept class to express a Concept that cannot be used in a Description different from the one that defines it. Also updated some comments.
In 3.14, added some comments.
In 3.15, removed some owl:disjointWith axioms relating Collection to InformationObject, Description, Situation, and SocialAgent. The rationale for doing that is to allow less strict constraints on domain relations involving collections that can be also conceived as descriptions, situations, social agents, or information objects; for example: a collection of sentences from a text (an information object) that are ranked with a relevance criterion can be still considered a text.
In 3.16, name of isActedBy changed to actsThrough, which is clearer. Also added SpatioTemporalRegion as constituted by a SpaceRegion and a TimeInterval.
In 3.17, removed redundant universal axioms from Entity and other top classes. Fixed restrictions on FunctionalSubstance class, and comments in Design and Substance classes.
In 3.18, removed subClassOf axiom from FunctionalSubstance to DesignedArtifact, created a new subclass of FunctionalSubstance, called DesignedSubstance, and created a subClassOf axiom from DesignedSubstance to DesignedArtifact.
In 3.19, removed disjointness axiom between Concept and Collection (the same rationale applies as in 3.15 version.
In 3.20, revised the comment for Quality, added InformationEntity as the superclass for InformationObject and InformationRealization (represented as the union of those classes). This is needed in many domain ontologies that do not need to distinguish between abstract and concrete aspects of information entities. One possible revision (not implemented here) would be to introduce the relations: expresses and isAbout with a broader domain:InformationEntity, and two more specific properties: abstractlyExpresses and isAbstractlyAbout. This last revision has not been implemented yet, since a large revision procedure should be carried out in order to check the impact of the revision on the existing DOLCE-DnS-Ultralite plugins.
In 3.21, added comment to InformationEntity, and optimized representation of equivalence for InformationRealization.
In 3.22, added comment to Personification.
In 3.23, added associatedWith object property, and put all object properties as subproperties of it.
In 3.24, removed hasProxy datatype property.
In 3.25, generalized domain and range of hasComponent and isComponentOf.
In 3.26, updated some comments in order to clarify or exemplify the concepts.
In 3.27, added rdfs:isDefinedBy annotations for Linked Data browsers.
In 3.28, broadened the universe of pre-/post-conditions to give room to events and states.
In 3.29, added some properties to support DBpedia alignment: sameSettingAs (situational analogous to coparticipation), including relations originating e.g. from sharing kinship, ownership, or roleplaying situations.
In 3.30, completed some domains and ranges (formerly owl:Thing, now dul:Entity), and added axiom: Organism subClassOf PhysicalAgent.
In 3.31, added a restriction to Quality and one to Region in order to ensure the original DOLCE constraint of qualities being always associated with a region, and vice versa. These axioms do not however exclude a direct applicability of qualities or regions to any other entity.
In 3.32, removed redundant union axioms and some restrictions, which spot a negative trade-off between expressivity and complexity.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "The DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology.
It is a simplification of some parts of the DOLCE Lite-Plus library (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DLP397.owl). 
Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following:

- The names of classes and relations have been made more intuitive
- The DnS-related part is closer to the newer 'constructive DnS' ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/cDnS.owl).
- Temporal and spatial relations are simplified
- Qualities and regions are more relaxed than in DOLCE-Full: they can be used as attributes of any entity; an axiom states that each quality has a region
- Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus
- The architecture of the ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules, called 'content ontology design patterns', which can be applied independently in the design of domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org).  If many modules are needed in a same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version.

The final result is a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social contexts.

More complex parametrization requires workarounds. E.g. AgeRangeForDrugUsage could parametrize data value: 14 to 50 on the datatype: xsd:int.

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).
Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.
If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.

(1) Alternative aspectual views

Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). 
In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).

The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? 
A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.
An alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. 
For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.
Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.

(2) Alternative intentionality views

Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.
Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. 
On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. 
Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.

(3) Alternative participant views

A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. 
For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.
Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).

Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. 
Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. 
For this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "? costituente di@it" "is constituent of@en" "'Constituency' depends on some layering of  the world described by the ontology. For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. 
Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.
A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "classifies@en" "classifica@it" "A relation between a Concept and an Entity, e.g. the Role 'student' classifies a Person 'John'.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "has Doc@en" "Descrizione@it" "Description@en" "A Description is a SocialObject that represents a conceptualization. 
It can be thought also as a 'descriptive context' that uses or defines concepts in order to create a view on a 'relational context' (cf. Situation) out of a set of data or observations. 
For example, a Plan is a Description of some actions to be executed by agents in a certain way, with certain parameters; a Diagnosis is a Description that provides an interpretation for a set of observed entities, etc.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "Situazione@it" "Situation@en" "A view, consistent with ('satisfying') a Description, on a set of entities. 
It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame' (i.e. a Description). 
For example, a PlanExecution is a context including some actions executed by agents according to certain parameters and expected tasks to be achieved from a Plan; a DiagnosedSituation is a context of observed entities that is interpreted on the basis of a Diagnosis, etc.
Situation is also able to represent reified n-ary relations, where isSettingFor is the top-level relation for all binary projections of the n-ary relation. If used in a transformation pattern for n-ary relations, the designer should take care of creating only one subclass of Situation for each n-ary relation, otherwise the 'identification constraint' (Calvanese et al., IJCAI 2001) could be violated.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "Plan execution@en" "Esecuzione di piano@it" "Plan executions are situations that proactively satisfy a plan.

For example, in sociology, a 'group action' is the situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group). This can be generalized to the notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as agents.
The difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective. In practice, this difference makes collective agents 'less stable' than organizations, because they have a dedicated, publicly recognizable Description that is conceived to introduce them.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "A transition is a Situation that creates a context for three TimeInterval(s), two additional different Situation(s), one Event, one Process, and at least one Object: the Event is observed as the cause for the transition, one Situation is the state before the transition, the second Situation is the state after the transition, the Process is the invariance under some different transitions (including the one represented here), in which at least one Object is situated. Finally, the time intervals position the situations and the transitional event in time.

There are several ways to encode values in DOLCE (Ultralite):

1) Directly assert an xsd:_ value to an Entity by using hasDataValue
2) Assert a Region for an Entity by using hasRegion, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
3) Assert a Quality for an Entity by using hasQuality, then assert a Region for that Quality, and assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
4) When the value is required, but not directly observed, assert a Parameter for an xsd:_ value by using hasParameterDataValue, and then associate the Parameter to an Entity by using isConstraintFor
5) When the value is required, but not directly observed, you can also assert a Parameter for a Region by using parametrizes, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue

The five approaches obey different requirements. 
For example, a simple value can be easily asserted by using pattern (1), but if one needs to assert an interval between two values, a Region should be introduced to materialize that interval, as pattern (2) suggests. 
Furthermore, if one needs to distinguish the individual Quality of a value, e.g. the particular nature of the density of a substance, pattern (3) can be used. 
Patterns (4) and (5) should be used instead when a constraint or a selection is modeled, independently from the actual observation of values in the real world.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "? postcondizione di@it" "is postcondition of@en" "Direct succession applied to situations.

For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. 
Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.
A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" "far from@en" "Generic distance relation between any Entity(s).

Mathematical and logical entities are included in this class: sets, categories, tuples, costants, variables, etc.
Abstract formal entities are distinguished from information objects, which are supposed to be part of a social context, and are localized in space and time, therefore being (social) objects.
For example, the class 'Quark' is an abstract formal entity from the purely set-theoretical perspective, but it is an InformationObject from the viewpoint of ontology design, when e.g. implemented in a logical language like OWL.
Abstract formal entities are also distinguished from Concept(s), Collection(s), and Description(s), which are part of a social context, therefore being SocialObject(s) as well.
For example, the class 'Quark' is an abstract FormalEntity from the purely set-theoretical perspective, but it is a Concept within history of science and cultural dynamics.

For example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:

- Beehive means "a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box." (Oxford dictionary)
- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 "beehive|hive" (WordNet)
- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'
- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'
- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'
- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'
- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'
- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'
- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'
- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)

As the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. 
However, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. 
We provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.

In the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). 
Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.
Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. 
A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.
Another approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.
The logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. 
Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.

These different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):

(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)
	- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'
	- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept
	- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description
	- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)
	- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)
	- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)

(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)
	- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl
	- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld

This is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];

Also, the names of the related properties have been changed in order to make them more intuitive.
Furthermore, a large comment field has been added to the 'expresses' object property, in order to clarify some issues about the many interpretations.
In 3.3, the relation between regions, parameters, and datatypes has been still improved.
In 3.5, the person-related classes have been refactored: Person in 3.4 is now SocialPerson, to avoid confusion with commonsense intuition; Person is now the union of social persons and humans, therefore being a subclass of Agent.
In 3.6, other fixes on universal restriction involving expresses. Also added the property 'isConstraintFor' between parameters and entities. Moved the properties: 'assumes' and 'adopts' to the new module: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/Conceptualization.owl.
In 3.7, some fixes on the names of classes and properties related to FormalEntity; created a new separate module for general universal restrictions (DULGCI.owl).
In 3.8, more fixes on the interface to formal entities and links to IOLite.owl.
In 3.9, some naming and comment fixes.
In 3.10, removed cardinality restriction from hasPart and isPartOf restrictions (changed to hasComponent and isComponentOf), for OWL(DL) compatibility. Also enlarged the range of includesAgent to contain both social and physical agents, and of conceptualizes universal restriction on agents, to include all social objects.
In 3.11, some more subproperty axioms have been introduced, and all elements have got English labels.
In 3.12, added some classes to map some old DolceLitePlus classes that were used to align OntoWordNet.
In 3.13, added the LocalConcept class to express a Concept that cannot be used in a Description different from the one that defines it. Also updated some comments.
In 3.14, added some comments.
In 3.15, removed some owl:disjointWith axioms relating Collection to InformationObject, Description, Situation, and SocialAgent. The rationale for doing that is to allow less strict constraints on domain relations involving collections that can be also conceived as descriptions, situations, social agents, or information objects; for example: a collection of sentences from a text (an information object) that are ranked with a relevance criterion can be still considered a text.
In 3.16, name of isActedBy changed to actsThrough, which is clearer. Also added SpatioTemporalRegion as constituted by a SpaceRegion and a TimeInterval.
In 3.17, removed redundant universal axioms from Entity and other top classes. Fixed restrictions on FunctionalSubstance class, and comments in Design and Substance classes.
In 3.18, removed subClassOf axiom from FunctionalSubstance to DesignedArtifact, created a new subclass of FunctionalSubstance, called DesignedSubstance, and created a subClassOf axiom from DesignedSubstance to DesignedArtifact.
In 3.19, removed disjointness axiom between Concept and Collection (the same rationale applies as in 3.15 version.
In 3.20, revised the comment for Quality, added InformationEntity as the superclass for InformationObject and InformationRealization (represented as the union of those classes). This is needed in many domain ontologies that do not need to distinguish between abstract and concrete aspects of information entities. One possible revision (not implemented here) would be to introduce the relations: expresses and isAbout with a broader domain:InformationEntity, and two more specific properties: abstractlyExpresses and isAbstractlyAbout. This last revision has not been implemented yet, since a large revision procedure should be carried out in order to check the impact of the revision on the existing DOLCE-DnS-Ultralite plugins.
In 3.21, added comment to InformationEntity, and optimized representation of equivalence for InformationRealization.
In 3.22, added comment to Personification.
In 3.23, added associatedWith object property, and put all object properties as subproperties of it.
In 3.24, removed hasProxy datatype property.
In 3.25, generalized domain and range of hasComponent and isComponentOf.
In 3.26, updated some comments in order to clarify or exemplify the concepts.
In 3.27, added rdfs:isDefinedBy annotations for Linked Data browsers.
In 3.28, broadened the universe of pre-/post-conditions to give room to events and states.
In 3.29, added some properties to support DBpedia alignment: sameSettingAs (situational analogous to coparticipation), including relations originating e.g. from sharing kinship, ownership, or roleplaying situations.
In 3.30, completed some domains and ranges (formerly owl:Thing, now dul:Entity), and added axiom: Organism subClassOf PhysicalAgent.
In 3.31, added a restriction to Quality and one to Region in order to ensure the original DOLCE constraint of qualities being always associated with a region, and vice versa. These axioms do not however exclude a direct applicability of qualities or regions to any other entity.
In 3.32, removed redundant union axioms and some restrictions, which spot a negative trade-off between expressivity and complexity.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "owl:versionInfo" ];
	"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl" -> "The DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology.
It is a simplification of some parts of the DOLCE Lite-Plus library (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DLP397.owl). 
Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following:

- The names of classes and relations have been made more intuitive
- The DnS-related part is closer to the newer 'constructive DnS' ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/cDnS.owl).
- Temporal and spatial relations are simplified
- Qualities and regions are more relaxed than in DOLCE-Full: they can be used as attributes of any entity; an axiom states that each quality has a region
- Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus
- The architecture of the ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules, called 'content ontology design patterns', which can be applied independently in the design of domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org).  If many modules are needed in a same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version.

The final result is a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social contexts.
Several extensions of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite have been designed: 
- Information objects: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl 
- Systems: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/SystemsLite.owl 
- Plans: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/PlansLite.owl
- Legal domain: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/CLO/CoreLegal.owl
- Lexical and semiotic domains: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L2.owl
- DOLCE-Zero: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl is a commonsense-oriented generalisation of some top-level classes, which allows to use DOLCE with tolerance against ambiguities like abstract vs. concrete information, locations vs. physical artifacts, event occurrences vs. event types, events vs. situations, qualities vs. regions, etc.; etc.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).
Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.
If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.

(1) Alternative aspectual views

Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). 
In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).

The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? 
A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.
An alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. 
For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.
Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.

(2) Alternative intentionality views

Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.
Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. 
On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. 
Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.

(3) Alternative participant views

A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. 
For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.
Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).

Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. 
Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. 
For this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];

Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.
A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];

This can be generalized to the notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as agents.
The difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective.

There are several ways to encode values in DOLCE (Ultralite):

1) Directly assert an xsd:_ value to an Entity by using hasDataValue
2) Assert a Region for an Entity by using hasRegion, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
3) Assert a Quality for an Entity by using hasQuality, then assert a Region for that Quality, and assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
4) When the value is required, but not directly observed, assert a Parameter for an xsd:_ value by using hasParameterDataValue, and then associate the Parameter to an Entity by using isConstraintFor
5) When the value is required, but not directly observed, you can also assert a Parameter for a Region by using parametrizes, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue

The five approaches obey different requirements. 
For example, a simple value can be easily asserted by using pattern (1), but if one needs to assert an interval between two values, a Region should be introduced to materialize that interval, as pattern (2) suggests. 
Furthermore, if one needs to distinguish the individual Quality of a value, e.g. the particular nature of the density of a substance, pattern (3) can be used. 
Patterns (4) and (5) should be used instead when a constraint or a selection is modeled, independently from the actual observation of values in the real world.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];

A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" [ label = "rdfs:comment" ];
